      We are an experienced and completely student-run high school club whose
      members work on both real life engineering projects and participate in the
      VEX Robotics Competition. Around 6 years old now, our club takes pride in
      its membersâ€™ teamwork and problem solving skills. We also heavily
      emphasize the engineering design process and ensure that all members have
      knowledge of such engineering aspects through our yearly seminars.
